		<h2>14.1. Sending Events</h2>
		</span>
		<p>
		An event is sent from a sender object to a receiver object, using an object pointer stored in one of the link fields, with an <spec>event ID</spec> and a set of arguments (up to a maximum of 7). Optionally, a condition may be used to determine whether to send the event or not. The specifics of the event instructions are specified in the instructions list chapter.
		</p>
		<p>
		There are three methods of sending events to other objects: sending an event directly, broadcasting an event to all objects, and cascading an event from a parent object. In all of these methods, the sender of the event is the object that called the event instruction.

		<span style="margin-left:20px"><h3 class="back">Direct Event</h3><h3>Direct Event</h3></span>
		<p>Sends an event directly to another object. The receiver is the object specified in the instruction.</p>
		<span style="margin-left:20px"><h3 class="back">Broadcast Event</h3><h3>Broadcast Event</h3></span>
		<p>Sends an event to all living objects. This type of event also runs a test on all potential objects to make it so only certain objects can receive the event. Whether an object receives the event is determined by the event test.</p>
		<span style="margin-left:20px"><h3 class="back">Cascade Event</h3><h3>Cascade Event</h3></span>
		<p>Recursively sends an event to all children of a target object. This type of event also runs a test on all potential objects to make it so only certain objects can receive the event. Whether an object receives the event is determined by the event test.</p>
